# Charges for Intraday Trades on a Single Stock

Let's understand the details around charges for intraday trades on a single stock and address some common misconception to avoid surprise costs.
The charges are currently 20 rupees with most brokers. But it was always not this **same**.

## Brokerage Per Order Execution:

* Brokerage is per executed order.
* Most popular discount brokers in India (like Zerodha, Groww, Angel One, and 5paisa) charge a flat brokerage fee per *executed order*.
* They do not charge per day or per stock.
* This is typically **₹20 per executed order** or a percentage of the trade value (e.g., 0.03%), whichever is lower.
* A "trade" often consists of two orders

An intraday trade involves at least two executed orders:
*   A "buy" order, and
*   A "sell" order.

So, if you execute one complete intraday trade (buy 100 shares, then sell 100 shares), you will be charged the brokerage fee twice.

## Multiple Trades, Multiple Charges

* If you do multiple trades on the same stock in a single day, each executed buy and sell order will incur its own brokerage charge.
* OR, you will incur a percentage of the trade value, whichever is lower.
* **For example:** If you make two separate intraday trades on the same stock, you will have four executed orders (buy, sell, buy, sell), and you will be charged the brokerage fee four times.

In summary, the **₹20 charge** is a **per-order** fee, **not** a per-day fee.

### Other charges to consider

* Beyond the brokerage fee, there are other statutory and regulatory charges that are levied on *each transaction*.
* These are not capped and are calculated based on the trade value and other factors.
* These additional charges can add up, especially with frequent trading, and are crucial to consider when calculating your net profit or loss.
* Most brokers provide a brokerage calculator on their websites to help you estimate the total cost of a trade before you execute it.

They include:
  * **Securities Transaction Tax (STT):** A tax levied by the government on the value of securities transactions.
  * **Exchange Transaction Charges:** Fees charged by the stock exchange (NSE/BSE) for using their platform.
  * **SEBI Turnover Fees:** A small fee charged by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
  * **Stamp Duty:** A state-specific tax on the transaction.
  * **GST:** An 18% Goods and Services Tax on the total of the brokerage, transaction charges, and SEBI fees.
